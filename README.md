# Project: Modernizing a Legacy 3-Tier Application with Gemini CLI Agent

This project serves as an experimental endeavor to explore the capabilities of the Gemini CLI agent in modernizing and migrating a legacy 3-tier application. The migration process is structured into multiple phases, each with distinct objectives.

## Project Phases:

### Phase 1: Lift-and-Shift to VM + CloudSQL (Completed)
*   **Objective**: To migrate the legacy application to a virtual machine (VM) and CloudSQL using existing migration solutions.
*   **Tools/Methods**: Migration Center, mcdc, DMS.

### Phase 2: Autonomous Migration with Gemini CLI Agent (Work in Progress)
*   **Objective**: To leverage the Gemini CLI agent in an autonomous mode (with minimal human supervision) to perform migration tasks.
*   **Focus**: Learning the capabilities and limitations of the Gemini CLI agent in an autonomous setting.

### Phase 3: Assisted Migration with Gemini CLI Agent + Human Intervention
*   **Objective**: To utilize the Gemini CLI agent with human intervention, providing debugging and specific instructions as needed.
*   **Focus**: Debugging, providing additional specific instructions along the way to guide the agent.

### Phase 4: Multi-Agent Migration (Stretched Target)
*   **Objective**: To explore the use of multiple agents (including background agents) for the migration process.
*   **Focus**: Packaging the solution as a Multi-Cloud Platform (MCP) for broader applicability.
