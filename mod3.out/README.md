```logs
check git logs, local changes that are not yet committed, run an end-2-end test, and then give me a summary of what phases and sub-stages have you completed and what is pending. refer to mod2.out folder for the sample code, these modules worked fine there

>> sometimes the agent is really acting lack of intelligence e.g. didn't know how to cd to mod3.out then run the test
