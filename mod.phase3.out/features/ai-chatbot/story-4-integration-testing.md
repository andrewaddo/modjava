### User Story

**Title:** Integration Testing for Chatbot

**Story:** As a developer, I want to have integration tests for the chatbot so that I can ensure it is working correctly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  An integration test verifies that the `/api/chatbot` endpoint returns a successful response.
2.  The test sends a sample message and asserts that the response contains a 'response' field.
