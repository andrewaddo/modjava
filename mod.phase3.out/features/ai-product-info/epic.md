### **Epic Title**

AI-Powered Product Information - Brownfield Enhancement

### **Epic Goal**

To enrich the user experience by providing AI-generated product details upon selection, increasing user engagement and providing deeper insights into products.

### **Epic Description**

**Existing System Context:**
*   **Current relevant functionality:** The application is a Java 17/Spring Boot shopping cart that allows users to select and view products.
*   **Technology stack:** Java 17, Spring Boot 3.4, Maven.
*   **Integration points:** The existing `web-app` module communicates with the `service` module to retrieve product data.

**Enhancement Details:**
*   **What's being added/changed:** When a user selects a product, the system will trigger a call to an external AI web search service to fetch additional, context-rich information about that product. This information will then be displayed to the user.
*   **How it integrates:** A new service will be added to the `service` module. This service will be responsible for calling the external AI API. The `web-app`'s product selection feature will be modified to call this new service and display the results in a new UI component.
*   **Success criteria:**
    1.  When a product is selected, relevant, AI-generated information is displayed to the user.
    2.  The feature does not negatively impact the performance of the product details page.
    3.  The UI for the additional information is clean, easy to read, and handles variable content gracefully.

### **Stories**

1.  **Story 1 (Backend Service):** Create a new service in the `service` module that accepts a product identifier. This service will call the designated external AI web search API, process the response, and return structured product information.
2.  **Story 2 (Frontend Integration):** Modify the `web-app` product page. When a product is selected, call the new backend service and display the returned AI-generated information in a dedicated section on the page.
3.  **Story 3 (UI Resilience & Polish):** Implement loading and error states for the AI content display. If the external API call is slow or fails, the user should see appropriate feedback. Consider implementing a caching mechanism to reduce latency on subsequent views of the same product.

### **Compatibility Requirements**

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged.
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (no changes expected).
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns.
- [x] Performance impact is minimal.

### **Risk Mitigation**

*   **Primary Risk:** The external AI service may be slow or unavailable, creating a poor user experience.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement aggressive timeouts and a caching strategy (e.g., cache results for 24 hours) to improve performance and reliability. The UI must have clear loading and error states.
*   **Rollback Plan:** The feature will be implemented with a feature flag. If critical issues arise, the flag can be toggled to disable the call to the new service without requiring a deployment.

### **Definition of Done**

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met.
- [x] Existing product selection functionality verified through testing.
- [x] The new AI information feature is working correctly.
- [x] Documentation for the new service and feature flag is created.
- [x] No regression in existing features.
