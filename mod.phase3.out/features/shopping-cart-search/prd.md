# PRD: Shopping Cart Search Enhancement

## 1. Intro Project Analysis and Context

### 1.1 Existing Project Overview

*   **1.1.1 Analysis Source**
    *   IDE-based fresh analysis.

*   **1.1.2 Current Project State**
    *   The project is a multi-module Java-based web application that implements a shopping cart system. It uses Maven for dependency management and is designed for deployment on Google Cloud Platform. Key features include user authentication, product browsing, a shopping cart, and order management. The project has undergone several iterations of development and bug fixing, particularly around the database schema, UI consistency, and deployment configurations.

### 1.2 Available Documentation Analysis

*   **1.2.1 Available Documentation**
    *   A `README.md` file exists, but it primarily contains development logs rather than formal documentation. Other formal documentation appears to be missing.
    *   **Recommendation:** For a more thorough analysis and to create a better foundation for future work, it is recommended to run the `document-project` task to generate comprehensive documentation for this existing codebase.

### 1.3 Enhancement Scope Definition

*   **1.3.1 Enhancement Type**
    *   Major Feature Modification & Bug Fix

*   **1.3.2 Enhancement Description**
    *   To fix the existing, non-functional product search feature and ensure it works as expected.

*   **1.3.3 Impact Assessment**
    *   Moderate Impact (some existing code changes are anticipated, but no major architectural changes).

### 1.4 Goals and Background Context

*   **1.4.1 Goals**
    *   Improve user experience by allowing users to find products quickly.
    *   Increase product discoverability.

*   **1.4.2 Background Context**
    *   Currently, users can only browse the list of all products. A search feature is a standard and essential component of any e-commerce application that will significantly improve the usability of this shopping cart system.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

*   **FR1:** The existing search bar in the header shall correctly accept user input.
*   **FR2:** Submitting the search form shall trigger a query to the database based on product names and descriptions.
*   **FR3:** The product listing page shall dynamically update to display only the products that match the search query.
*   **FR4:** If no products match the search query, a clear "No products found" message shall be displayed.
*   **FR5:** All existing functionality on the product cards (e.g., "Add to Cart", "View") must remain fully functional for the displayed search results.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR1:** Search results should be returned to the user in under 2 seconds on average.
*   **NFR2:** The search input must be properly sanitized to prevent SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities.
*   **NFR3:** The search feature should not increase the application's memory footprint by more than 10%.

### 2.3 Compatibility Requirements

*   **CR1:** The fix must work with the existing database schema without requiring any breaking changes or data migrations.
*   **CR2:** The fix should not require any changes to the existing search bar UI, which is already consistent with the site's design.
*   **CR3:** The implementation must not break any existing API endpoints or backend functionality.

## 3. User Interface Enhancement Goals

*   **3.1 Integration with Existing UI**
    *   The existing search bar is already well-integrated into the application's header and is consistent with the site's design. No changes to its placement or integration are required.

*   **3.2 Modified/New Screens and Views**
    *   The only screen affected is the main product listing page (`/products`). The change will be to the backend logic that filters the products displayed on this page, not to the visual layout itself.

*   **3.3 UI Consistency Requirements**
    *   No new UI elements are being introduced. The goal is to make the existing UI functional. Therefore, UI consistency will be maintained by default.

---

## 4. Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

*   **4.1 Existing Technology Stack**
    *   **Languages**: Java
    *   **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, Spring Security, Thymeleaf
    *   **Database**: PostgreSQL
    *   **Build Tool**: Maven
    *   **Frontend**: HTML, Bootstrap, jQuery
    *   **Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Platform (GKE/Cloud Run, Cloud SQL)

*   **4.2 Integration Approach**
    *   **Database Integration**: The fix will be implemented within the existing data access layer (likely Spring Data JPA). A new query method will be added to the `ProductRepository` to filter products based on the search term.
    *   **API Integration**: The fix will modify the controller for the existing `/products` GET endpoint to process the `search` request parameter that is already being sent by the frontend.
    *   **Frontend Integration**: No changes are required. The existing search form in the header will be used as-is.
    *   **Testing Integration**: New unit tests will be created for the search logic in the service and repository layers. A new integration test will be added to verify the `/products?search=...` endpoint returns correctly filtered data.

*   **4.3 Code Organization and Standards**
    *   All new code will follow the existing multi-module structure (`data-access`, `service`, `web-app`). The changes will be localized to the appropriate modules (e.g., repository changes in `data-access`, controller changes in `web-app`).

*   **4.4 Deployment and Operations**
    *   No changes are anticipated to the existing build (`mvn clean install`) or deployment (`deploy.sh`) processes.

*   **4.5 Risk Assessment and Mitigation**
    *   **Technical Risks**: An inefficient database query for the search could cause performance issues as the number of products grows.
    *   **Mitigation**: The database query will be optimized, and we will ensure that the relevant columns (`name`, `description`) are indexed in the database to ensure fast lookups.

## 5. Epic and Story Structure

### Epic 1: Fix and Enhance Product Search Functionality

*   **Epic Goal**: To deliver a fully functional, performant, and secure product search feature that allows users to easily find products, resolving the issues with the existing implementation.

#### Story Sequence

**Story 1.1: Implement Backend Search Logic**
*   **As a** developer,
*   **I want** to create a robust method in the `ProductRepository` that searches for products by name and description,
*   **so that** the application has a reliable way to query the database for products matching a search term.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    1.  A method exists in the `ProductRepository` that accepts a search string and returns a `List<Product>`.
    2.  The search is case-insensitive.
    3.  The method is covered by a unit test that verifies it returns correct results.
*   **Integration Verification**:
    1.  The new repository method does not break any existing repository methods or tests.

**Story 1.2: Integrate Search Logic into the Controller**
*   **As a** developer,
*   **I want** to modify the `/products` controller endpoint to use the new search repository method when a `search` parameter is present,
*   **so that** the web application can display filtered search results to the user.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    1.  When the `/products` endpoint is called with a `search` parameter, it returns a view populated with only the matching products.
    2.  When the `/products` endpoint is called without a `search` parameter, it continues to return all products as before.
    3.  The controller logic is covered by a unit test.
*   **Integration Verification**:
    1.  The `/products` endpoint remains fully functional for all non-search-related requests.

**Story 1.3: Verify End-to-End Search Functionality**
*   **As a** QA tester,
*   **I want** to perform an end-to-end test of the search feature,
*   **so that** I can verify it is working correctly from the UI to the database and is secure.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    1.  Typing a search term in the UI and submitting returns the correct, filtered list of products.
    2.  Searching for a term that does not match any product displays the "No products found" message.
    3.  The feature is secure against basic SQL injection attempts.
*   **Integration Verification**:
    1.  A new integration test is created that covers the full, end-to-end search flow.
    2.  Manually verify that all other user actions (e.g., "Add to Cart", "View") still work correctly from the search results page.
