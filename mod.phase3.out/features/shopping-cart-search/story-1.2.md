# Story 1.2: Integrate Search Logic into the Controller
*   **As a** developer,
*   **I want** to modify the `/products` controller endpoint to use the new search repository method when a `search` parameter is present,
*   **so that** the web application can display filtered search results to the user.
*   **Acceptance Criteria**:
    1.  When the `/products` endpoint is called with a `search` parameter, it returns a view populated with only the matching products.
    2.  When the `/products` endpoint is called without a `search` parameter, it continues to return all products as before.
    3.  The controller logic is covered by a unit test.
*   **Integration Verification**:
    1.  The `/products` endpoint remains fully functional for all non-search-related requests.
