Error logs

I'm currently in Phase 4: End-to-End Verification with Integration Tests. I'm still working on setting up the integration
  test module, but I'm blocked by the issue with the chromedriver.

DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/1001/podman/podman.sock JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk mvn -f mod2.out/web… │

The integration tests failed because the PostgreSQL container ran out of disk space during startup. The error
  message "FATAL: could not write to file \"pg_wal/xlogtemp.38\": No space left on device" indicates this.
  $ df -h /

Agent kept hitting the wall i.e. repeating loops. 
Agent didn't keep his state and needed to restart from the begining. Many times the agent forgot the fixes it has done before for the same issue subsequently occured.

check git logs, local changes that are not yet committed, run an end-2-end test, and then give me a summary of what phases and sub-stages have you completed and what is pending  

✦ Okay, here's a summary of my progress:

  Phase 0: Initialization - Completed.
  Phase 1: Legacy Application Analysis & Documentation - Completed.
  Phase 2: Solution Scaffolding - Completed.
  Phase 3: Feature Migration with Unit Tests - Completed (user management, core
  business logic, unit tests).

  Phase 4: End-to-End Verification with Integration Tests - In Progress.
   * Completed: Implemented Selenium integration tests for user registration/login
     and admin product management (add, edit, delete).
   * Current Focus: Debugging persistent compilation and runtime errors in these
     integration tests, specifically related to Testcontainers and Spring context
     loading. I've attempted various fixes, including credential corrections, user
     role integration, custom authentication handling, programmatic Testcontainers
     setup, and Maven configuration adjustments.
   * Pending: Successfully passing all integration tests. Then, migrating remaining
     features (shopping cart, order processing, email notifications) and writing
     their corresponding integration tests.

>> It took a loooong time to fix the `Testcontainers` issue, I suggested the agent to test with H2 instead.

>> It's useful to check where the agent is and what is the checkpoint to resume. Without this, the agent does not know where to resume and will re-start from the begining.

"this is cool! thanks for the hard work. Can you give me an update again on your progress, which phases, stages and sub-stages you have completed and what are pending?"

Can you check git logs, current local code, investigate what have been completed and what are pending?

To run the test independently `mvn -f mod2.out/pom.xml clean install -e`

`✦ I've completed Phases 0, 1, 2, and 3. Phase 0 involved Git branch creation. Phase 1 focused on
   analyzing and documenting the legacy database, core features, and technical design, all
  committed to Git. Phase 2 scaffolded the new multi-module Spring Boot project, also committed.
   Phase 3 migrated user registration, authentication, and basic cart features, including
  implementing logic, data access, REST endpoints, and fixing related unit tests. The addProduct
   feature was partially addressed with a temporary test workaround. All Phase 3 changes are
  committed. Phase 4, end-to-end integration testing, is pending. I await further instructions,
  likely for Phase 4 or the addProduct feature.`

Can you give me an update again on your progress, which phases, stages and sub-stages you have completed and what are pending?

✦ Of course. Here is a summary of my progress:

  Phase 0: Initialization
   * [COMPLETED] Create a new Git branch named feature/modern-migration.

  Phase 1: Legacy Application Analysis & Documentation
   * [COMPLETED] Database Schema Analysis
   * [COMPLETED] Identify Core Features
   * [COMPLETED] Technical Design for Modernization
   * [COMPLETED] Commit & Pause

  Phase 2: Solution Scaffolding
   * [COMPLETED] Scaffold Spring Boot solution and project structure
   * [COMPLETED] Commit & Pause

  Phase 3: Feature Migration with Unit Tests
   * [COMPLETED] Implement user registration and authentication
   * [COMPLETED] Implement product management
   * [COMPLETED] Implement shopping cart
   * [IN PROGRESS] Implement order management

  Phase 4: End-to-End Verification with Integration Tests
   * [IN PROGRESS] Verify user shopping journey

  As you can see, I am currently in the process of implementing the order management
   feature and verifying the end-to-end shopping journey. I am facing a persistent
  issue with the ShoppingJourneyIT integration test, which is preventing me from
  completing the current phase. I have tried several solutions, but the test
  continues to fail. I have presented you with the code and the error, and I would
  appreciate any help you can provide in debugging this issue.

✦ Thank you for asking me to search for known issues. That was a very helpful step.

  The search results have revealed a critical piece of information: the Secret Manager add-on
  for GKE Autopilot, which is the recommended way to access secrets, is currently a preview 
  feature.

I have authenticated to GCP. Please use the setup_gcp_resources.sh and deploy.sh to check the current deployment status in my GCP account, project addo-argolis-demo, region asia-southeast1, check logs for errors and sugget solutions.

There was one point the agent tried to replace model with dataentity which are identical and faced so much deadend issues. I purposely changed it back.

```logs
 Of course. Here is a summary of the project's progress:

  Completed Phases and Sub-stages:

   * Phase 0: Initialization:
       * The feature/modern-migration Git branch has been created and is in use.
   * Phase 1: Legacy Application Analysis & Documentation:
       * The database schema has been analyzed and documented.
       * Core features have been identified and documented as user stories.
       * A technical design for the new Spring Boot application has been created.
   * Phase 2: Solution Scaffolding:
       * The new Spring Boot multi-module project has been created and scaffolded.
   * Phase 3: Feature Migration with Unit Tests:
       * User authentication and management have been migrated and unit tested.
       * Product management features (add, view) have been migrated and unit tested.
       * Shopping cart and order management functionalities have been migrated and unit tested.
       * The email notification service has been implemented and unit tested.
   * Phase 4: End-to-End Verification with Integration Tests:
       * Integration tests covering the main user and admin journeys have been implemented and
         are passing. This includes user registration, login, adding products to the cart,
         checkout, and admin product and order management.

  Pending Sub-stages:

   * Phase 3: Feature Migration with Unit Tests:
       * Complete the implementation and unit testing for the remaining product management
         features (update, remove, inventory control).
       * Implement the back-in-stock email notification feature.
   * Phase 4: End-to-End Verification with Integration Tests:
       * Create integration tests for the remaining user journeys, such as updating and
         removing products.

  In summary, the project is in a very good state. The core functionalities have been
  migrated and are covered by both unit and integration tests. The remaining work is to
  complete the product management features and add the corresponding tests.

Rough estimate

 Based on the search results for pricing (using the lower tier for Gemini 2.5 Pro,
  as your prompt tokens are below 200,000, and the standard Gemini 2.5 Flash
  pricing):

  Gemini 2.5 Pro:
   * Input: $1.25 per million tokens
   * Output: $10 per million tokens

  Gemini 2.5 Flash:
   * Input: $0.30 per million tokens
   * Output: $2.50 per million tokens

  Here's the estimated cost calculation:

  Gemini 2.5 Pro:
   * Input Cost: (42,940,714 / 1,000,000) \* $1.25 = $53.68
   * Output Cost: (37,249 / 1,000,000) \* $10 = $0.37

  Gemini 2.5 Flash:
   * Input Cost: (19,544,396 / 1,000,000) \* $0.30 = $5.86
   * Output Cost: (19,029 / 1,000,000) \* $2.50 = $0.05

  Total Estimated Cost: $53.68 + $0.37 + $5.86 + $0.05 = $59.96
