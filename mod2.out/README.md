Error logs

```logs
I'm currently in Phase 4: End-to-End Verification with Integration Tests. I'm still working on setting up the integration
  test module, but I'm blocked by the issue with the chromedriver.

DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/1001/podman/podman.sock JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk mvn -f mod2.out/web… │

The integration tests failed because the PostgreSQL container ran out of disk space during startup. The error
  message "FATAL: could not write to file \"pg_wal/xlogtemp.38\": No space left on device" indicates this.
  $ df -h /
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/nvme0n1p2   20G   20G   20K 100% /

--> extended the disk space to 500G

Agent kept hitting the wall i.e. repeating loops. 
Agent didn't keep his state and needed to restart from the begining. Many times the agent forgot the fixes it has done before for the same issue subsequently occured.

check git logs, local changes that are not yet committed, run an end-2-end test, and then give me a summary of what phases and sub-stages have you completed and what is pending  

✦ Okay, here's a summary of my progress:

  Phase 0: Initialization - Completed.
  Phase 1: Legacy Application Analysis & Documentation - Completed.
  Phase 2: Solution Scaffolding - Completed.
  Phase 3: Feature Migration with Unit Tests - Completed (user management, core
  business logic, unit tests).

  Phase 4: End-to-End Verification with Integration Tests - In Progress.
   * Completed: Implemented Selenium integration tests for user registration/login
     and admin product management (add, edit, delete).
   * Current Focus: Debugging persistent compilation and runtime errors in these
     integration tests, specifically related to Testcontainers and Spring context
     loading. I've attempted various fixes, including credential corrections, user
     role integration, custom authentication handling, programmatic Testcontainers
     setup, and Maven configuration adjustments.
   * Pending: Successfully passing all integration tests. Then, migrating remaining
     features (shopping cart, order processing, email notifications) and writing
     their corresponding integration tests.

>> It took a loooong time to fix the `Testcontainers` issue, I suggested the agent to test with H2 instead.

>> It's useful to check where the agent is and what is the checkpoint to resume. Without this, the agent does not know where to resume and will re-start from the begining.

"this is cool! thanks for the hard work. Can you give me an update again on your progress, which phases, stages and sub-stages you have completed and what are pending?"

To run the test independently `mvn -f mod2.out/pom.xml clean install -e`

       * User Registration IT.
       * Admin Add Product IT.

  Pending:
   * Phase 3: Feature Migration with Unit Tests:
       * Complete UI/controller implementation and full unit test coverage for Shopping Cart,
         Order Processing, and Admin Order Management.
       * Implement remaining Product Management features (update, remove) at the UI/controller
         level and their unit tests.
   * Phase 4: End-to-End Verification with Integration Tests:
       * Develop integration tests for all remaining user journeys, including "User adds
         product to cart and checks out," "Admin updates product," and "Admin removes product."

`✦ I've completed Phases 0, 1, 2, and 3. Phase 0 involved Git branch creation. Phase 1 focused on
   analyzing and documenting the legacy database, core features, and technical design, all
  committed to Git. Phase 2 scaffolded the new multi-module Spring Boot project, also committed.
   Phase 3 migrated user registration, authentication, and basic cart features, including
  implementing logic, data access, REST endpoints, and fixing related unit tests. The addProduct
   feature was partially addressed with a temporary test workaround. All Phase 3 changes are
  committed. Phase 4, end-to-end integration testing, is pending. I await further instructions,
  likely for Phase 4 or the addProduct feature.`

Eventually, it gives up

```logs
Can you give me an update again on your progress, which phases, stages and sub-stages you have completed and what are pending?

✦ Of course. Here is a summary of my progress:

  Phase 0: Initialization
   * [COMPLETED] Create a new Git branch named feature/modern-migration.

  Phase 1: Legacy Application Analysis & Documentation
   * [COMPLETED] Database Schema Analysis
   * [COMPLETED] Identify Core Features
   * [COMPLETED] Technical Design for Modernization
   * [COMPLETED] Commit & Pause

  Phase 2: Solution Scaffolding
   * [COMPLETED] Scaffold Spring Boot solution and project structure
   * [COMPLETED] Commit & Pause

  Phase 3: Feature Migration with Unit Tests
   * [COMPLETED] Implement user registration and authentication
   * [COMPLETED] Implement product management
   * [COMPLETED] Implement shopping cart
   * [IN PROGRESS] Implement order management

  Phase 4: End-to-End Verification with Integration Tests
   * [IN PROGRESS] Verify user shopping journey

  As you can see, I am currently in the process of implementing the order management
   feature and verifying the end-to-end shopping journey. I am facing a persistent
  issue with the ShoppingJourneyIT integration test, which is preventing me from
  completing the current phase. I have tried several solutions, but the test
  continues to fail. I have presented you with the code and the error, and I would
  appreciate any help you can provide in debugging this issue.

✦ Thank you for asking me to search for known issues. That was a very helpful step.

  The search results have revealed a critical piece of information: the Secret Manager add-on
  for GKE Autopilot, which is the recommended way to access secrets, is currently a preview 
  feature.

I have authenticated to GCP. Please use the setup_gcp_resources.sh and deploy.sh to check the current deployment status in my GCP account, project addo-argolis-demo, region asia-southeast1, check logs for errors and sugget solutions.

```

```bash
## Deploying the app to GCP
./setup_gcp_resources.sh 

--- GCP Resource Setup Complete! ---

Database Name: shopping_cart_db
Database User Secret Name: cloud-sql-username
Database Password Secret Name: cloud-sql-password

```bash
# Test the app locally
## client
sudo dnf install postgresql # client
## server
sudo dnf install postgresql-server # server
### initialize the database
sudo postgresql-setup --initdb

# Open the `pg_hba.conf` file in a text editor with `sudo` privileges. Find the line that looks like this:

# local   all             postgres                                peer

And change `peer` to `md5` or `scram-sha-256`. `md5` is fine for local development.
